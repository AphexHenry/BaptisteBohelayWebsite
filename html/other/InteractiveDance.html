	<H2> <strong>Interactive Dance Performance with Visuals</strong><P>
		<br>
	<H4>
		<p>This is my first experience with both dance performance and a Kinect. The dancer is represented by particles and projected on a screen. He create flows that move the particles by moving his hands, thus create a disformed reflection of him self he can play with.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>This performance has been presented at the Yukon Art Center, Whitehorse, in November 2013.</p>
