	<H2> <strong>Cocoons - Fête des Lumières 2014</strong><P>
		<br>
	<H4>
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Lights_(Lyon)" target="_blank">The Fête des Lumières</a> is the biggest light festival in the world with about 4 million visitors each years. Artists and companies from everywhere present their work based on light and transform the whole city into an art exhibition.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Cocoons is a light and sound interactive installation. 13 creatures are settled on the rooftops of the Saint-Luc Saint-Joseph hospital. Each cocoon is reactive to light and the audience is invited to "talk" with them with the light of their phones or flash lights. Depending on their mood, the cocoon can get angry, or sing for us, transforming this installation into a giant musical instrument.</p>
