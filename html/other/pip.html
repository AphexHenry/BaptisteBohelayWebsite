		<H5> <strong>projection intérieure projection</strong> is an interactive installation by artists Marten Berkman and Baptise Bohelay that explores human presence within natural and manufactured landscapes. Experimenting with sensors, software programming, and 3D video, gallery dweller's movements appear as disembodied shadows cast against palpable, pristine landscapes. The use of technology as a vehicle for remembrance is both poetic and haunting, urging a timely meditation on how we occupy and impact wild expanses of land.<P>
