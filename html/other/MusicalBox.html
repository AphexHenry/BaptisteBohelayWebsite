	<H2> <strong>Musical Box for everyone!</strong><P>
		<br>
	<H4>
		<p>Make you own musical box with paper and a draw the notes with a felt pen. Then play it with my app and your webcam. That's easy! You can build it with anything and write the notes on any paper. The app will analyse the notes painted on the paper and will play midi sounds while you rotate it. This version is a draft.</p>
