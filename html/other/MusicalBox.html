	<H2> <strong>Musical Box for everyone!</strong><P>
		<br>
	<H4>
		<p>This is a draft for now. The goal is to make it so anybody can make his own music box and play it with my app and their webcam. You can build it with anything and write the notes with a felt pen, on any paper. The app will analyse the notes painted on the paper and will play midi sounds while you rotate it.</p>
