		<H3> about me
		<H5>
			<br>
			<p>I am an application developer specialized in interactive technologies.

			<p>I love to be surprised by what I do so I experiment a lot. Mistakes are my friends.

			<p>This website was an experiment that mutated to a portfolio. I invite you here to navigate through this universe, to discover my explorations. It's actually the best way to get your mind around me.
			<p>Have fun!
