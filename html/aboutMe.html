		<H3> about me
		<H5>
			<br>
			<p>Let's just say that I love to experiment. Creating something new, something never seen or never heard is what thrills me. And if that could give a new perspective on anything to anybody I would be happy.

			<p>This website itself is another experiment that mutated to something more functional. I invite you here to navigate through this universe, to discover my explorations.
			<p>It's actually the best way to get your mind around me. Have fun!
