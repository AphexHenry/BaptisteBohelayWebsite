		<p>This work has been done in an original way, every act is improvised and spontaneously created. It was very important for me not to explain how the user has to play and how he has to interpret the story. The goal is to keep a deconstructed story. I let the player creating the missing pieces, trying to make the experience different and maybe more personnal.</p><br>

		<p class="text-info">There is no rules in this game, no point, just the exploration</p>
		<br><br>

		<p>I am currently looking for some funding to continue the game.</p><br>
